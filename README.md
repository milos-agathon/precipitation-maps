# Precipitation maps with ggplot2 and rayshader in R
In this tutorial, I'll show you how to use the pRecipe to download the MSWEP data, compute the average precipitation for any location and time period of your interest and use ggplot2 and rayshader to create beautiful 2D and 3D maps that show the variation of precipitation across space.
